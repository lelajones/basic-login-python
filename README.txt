APPLICATION OVERVIEW
The system will ask the user for their phone number and password
once they have created an account. The system will then compare
that password’s hash value with the stored hash value.

If the hash value has no match, the system will inform the user
of an incorrect password. If there is a match, the system will
send a secret code to the user’s phone number.

The system will then prompt the user for the secret code.
The code will be 6 randomized digits. The system will then check
that the secret code matches the code generated by the system.
If the code matches, the user will be authenticated and allowed
to “enter” their account.
